# AGENTS.md — Agent & Skill Governance

> **Scope:** All agents, skills, and AI-assisted workflows in the `a2a-brainstorm` codebase.
> **Source of Truth:** `docs/A2A-agent-Brainstorm.md` (architecture) + `docs/PLAN.md` (tasks)

## Overview

This document governs how GitHub Copilot agents and skills are structured, loaded, and composed in this project. It is the primary reference for anyone creating a new agent, skill, or AI-assisted workflow.

## Reference Documents

| Document                          | Purpose                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `docs/A2A-agent-Brainstorm.md`    | **Single source of truth.** Architecture, modules, API, data flows, A2A interaction model.       |
| `docs/PLAN.md`                    | Implementation plan — 15 tasks with exact files, validation steps, and deep knowledge reference. |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Copilot global rules enforced on every session — invariants, stack, forbidden patterns.          |
| `.github/agents/`                 | Agent definitions (`.agent.md` files). Each file is one deployable agent mode.                   |
| `.github/skills/`                 | Skill definitions (`SKILL.md` files). Skills are pre-digested knowledge packages.                |

---

## Agent Registry

Agents are defined in `.github/agents/`. Each `.agent.md` file declares one agent mode with a YAML frontmatter header and a Markdown body.

### Current Agents

| Agent         | File                                  | Purpose                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task-runner` | `.github/agents/task-runner.agent.md` | Implements tasks from `docs/PLAN.md`. Production-ready code per task. Non-interactive.          |
| `Explore`     | `.github/agents/Explore.agent.md`     | Read-only codebase explorer. Finds patterns, traces data flows, answers questions. Never edits. |

### Agent Frontmatter Schema

Every agent file **must** include this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <agent-name> # machine-readable, kebab-case
description: "..." # one sentence; appears in agent picker
argument-hint: "..." # example invocation shown to the user
tools: [...] # explicit tool allowlist
---
```

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md`
2. Define frontmatter (name, description, argument-hint, tools)
3. Write the agent body:
   - `## Role` — what this agent does and its constraints
   - `## Skills Used` — list of skill file paths this agent loads
   - `## Subagents Used` — downstream agents it may invoke via `runSubagent`
   - `## Execution Model` — step-by-step workflow
4. Register the agent in the **Current Agents** table above
5. Add it to the **Agent–Skill Composition** matrix in this file

### Agent Rules

- **One responsibility per agent** — agents must not overlap in scope
- **Never modify docs/** — agents may read `docs/` files but never write to them
- **`docs/PLAN.md` is the task source** — agents do not invent tasks; they implement from the plan
- **Non-interactive by default** — agents must complete their assigned work without mid-session questions unless the agent is explicitly interactive (e.g., `Explore`)
- **Load skills before reasoning** — always load relevant skill files first; skills are cheaper context than re-reading raw docs

---

## Skill Registry

Skills are defined in `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Skills are pre-digested knowledge packages — compact, opinionated, and reusable across agents.

### Skill File Schema

Every `SKILL.md` **must** begin with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name> # kebab-case, matches directory name
type: skill
description: >
  One paragraph. Describes when to load this skill.
---
```

The body must contain at minimum:

- `## Purpose` — what this skill enforces
- `## Rules` — numbered, enforceable constraints
- `## Checklist` — testable exit criteria

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. Write frontmatter (name, type, description)
3. Write body (Purpose, Rules, Checklist)
4. Register the skill in the **Current Skills** table above
5. Add it to any relevant agent in the **Agent–Skill Composition Matrix** below

### Skill Loading Rules

- **Load skills before reading raw docs** — skills are pre-digested and consume fewer tokens
- **Reference, do not repeat** — say "per `a2a-protocol-patterns` skill" instead of restating its rules
- **Progressive disclosure**: skill → doc section → full doc (load only what is needed)
- Each agent declares its skills explicitly in a `## Skills Used` section

---

## Always-Active Skills

These skills apply to **every agent and every task** without explicit loading. All agents must honour them.

| Skill                         | Reason Always Active                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorming`               | Design-first gate — NEVER write code before presenting a design and approval |
| `writing-plans`               | After approval, break work into 2–5 min tasks before implementing            |
| `subagent-driven-development` | Dispatch fresh subagent per task with 2-stage spec + quality review          |
| `test-driven-development`     | No production code without a failing test first (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)         |
| `caveman`                     | Compress output ~75% when user requests it — no filler, full accuracy        |
| `rtk`                         | Use `rtk <cmd>` for terminal output (60-90% token savings)                   |

> **Superpowers shorthand:** `brainstorming` + `writing-plans` + `subagent-driven-development` + `test-driven-development` are collectively the **superpowers** and are always active.

---

## Agent–Skill Composition Matrix

Cells marked ✅ mean the agent explicitly loads that skill.

## SubAgent Delegation Map

| Caller Agent  | Delegates To | Purpose                                |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `task-runner` | `Explore`    | Read-only research before writing code |

---

## Protected Files Policy

These files have strict modification rules. All agents must honour them.

| Path                           | Rule                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/A2A-agent-Brainstorm.md` | **Read-only.** The source blueprint. Never modified after design is locked.           |
| `docs/PLAN.md`                 | **Task progress comments only** (`✅ Task N completed`). Never rewrite task bodies.   |
| `docs/PLAN.md §8`              | **Read-only during execution.** Deep knowledge reference; never edited by agents.     |
| `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md`    | **Read-only during task execution.** Skills are updated only in dedicated sessions.   |
| `.github/agents/*.agent.md`    | **Read-only during task execution.** Agents are updated only in dedicated sessions.   |
| `migrations/*.sql`             | **Append-only.** New migration files may be added; existing files are never modified. |
| `contracts/`                   | **Additive only.** New types allowed; existing types never modified.                  |

---

## File Ownership Rule

Each task in `docs/PLAN.md` lists exactly the files it owns under `### Files to create`. **An agent must only write to files owned by the currently assigned task.** If a compile error requires touching a file owned by a different task, stop and fix it within the current task's own files (compatibility shim or interface boundary).

---

## Validation Requirement

Every task and every agent session must end with **all 9 quality gate steps** executed in order. Each step must reach **zero findings** before the next begins.

### Mandatory Final Todo Sequence (ordered, non-skippable)

| Step | Action               | Command / Check                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Check test cases** | Identify tests that cover changed code; create any that are missing       |
| 2    | **Run test cases**   | `go test ./...` (backend/agent) · `pnpm test` (frontend)                  |
| 3    | **Fix test cases**   | Zero test failures required before proceeding                             |
| 4    | **Check security**   | Review for OWASP Top 10, secrets exposure, injection, input validation    |
| 5    | **Fix security**     | Zero security findings required before proceeding                         |
| 6    | **Check linter**     | `go vet ./...` (backend/agent) · `pnpm lint` (frontend)                   |
| 7    | **Fix linter**       | Zero linter warnings/errors required before proceeding                    |
| 8    | **Check errors**     | `go build ./...` (backend/agent) · `pnpm check` + `pnpm build` (frontend) |
| 9    | **Fix errors**       | Zero compile/type errors required before marking task complete            |

> **A task is NOT complete until all 9 steps show zero findings.**
> These steps must be explicit todo items in `manage_todo_list` — not just mentally assumed.

---

## Security Invariants (All Agents Must Enforce)

These rules apply to every file any agent produces. They are not negotiable.

1. **API keys are never stored in source code, config files, or logs.** `CredentialRef` stores the env var _name_ only (e.g. `"CLAUDE_API_KEY"`); the actual key is resolved at runtime via `os.Getenv(credentialRef)`.
2. **All `os.Getenv()` calls are confined to `backend/internal/platform/config/config.go` (backend) and `agent/internal/config/config.go` (agent binary).** No other file may call `os.Getenv()`.
3. **`llm_config` JSONB column stores only `{provider, model, credential_ref}`.** The key value must never appear in the DB.
4. **Absent credential env var at startup → agent marked unavailable.** No silent fallback to another provider.
5. **No SQL string interpolation.** All queries use parameterized statements (pgx named params).
6. **Input validation on all HTTP handlers** — UUID format, non-empty required fields, bounded numeric inputs. Return `400` on violation; never pass raw user input to SQL or LLM prompts.
7. See `.github/skills/security-audit/SKILL.md` for the full OWASP checklist.

---

## Naming Conventions

Source files are named after the **domain concept or behavior** they implement — never after sprint tasks, phase labels, or ticket numbers.

| Bad (opaque)    | Good (functional)        | Reason                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `phase4.go`     | `convergence_engine.go`  | Names the domain concept         |
| `task3_impl.go` | `llm_resolver.go`        | Describes what the code does     |
| `helpers.go`    | `prompt_assembly.go`     | Disambiguates the specific logic |
| `b2_test.go`    | `merge_strategy_test.go` | Names the behavior under test    |

### Duplicate Package Declaration Guard

Automated formatters (editors, CI tools) sometimes prepend a bare `package <name>` line **before** the doc-comment block of a `.go` file. This produces a duplicate `package` declaration and causes the compile error:

```
expected declaration, found 'package'
```

**Rule:** After every file creation or edit, check that line 1 of each `.go` file is either the doc comment (`// Package …`) or the single `package` declaration — never both. If a stray `package` line appears before the doc comment, remove it immediately before proceeding.

Example of the broken pattern (FORBIDDEN):

```go
package llm           ← stray duplicate injected by formatter
// Package llm …
package llm           ← real declaration

Correct form:

```go
// Package llm …
package llm
```

## Module Boundary Rules

See `.github/skills/modularity/SKILL.md` for full rules. Summary:

- `backend/internal/modules/<name>/` — vertical slice: `handler.go`, `service.go`, `repository.go`, `model.go`
- Modules communicate only via types from `backend/internal/shared/` or their own exported service interface
- No module imports another module's internal packages (no `internal/modules/session` → `internal/modules/agent/repository`)
- All DB access goes through the module's own repository, not another module's repository
- `backend/internal/platform/` is shared infrastructure; any module may import it

## Skill Invocation

To invoke a skill from a chat session or agent, reference it by path:

```
#file:.github/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md
```

Or reference it from copilot-instructions for automatic loading:

```
See `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for rules.
```

Skills are loaded on-demand, not pre-loaded into every context window. Prefer skills over re-reading full docs.
